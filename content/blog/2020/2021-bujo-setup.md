As per usual, a new notebook for the new year! This time, I went with an Archer and Olive instead of my usual Leuchtturm.

I set this up live on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/c/letteredplans). I'm also experimenting with a self-hosted livestream setup, which you can find [here](/live). Thanks to all who joined in and watched!

The pages are bright white (which I love compared to the LT's yellow), and also *much* thicker, which is awesome! However, that does mean that this notebook is a little bit thicker and has less pages (mine has 160).

# Setup

As usual, I kept it pretty simple. I'll add in spreads throughout the year as I need too.

Supplies:

- MUJI black gel pen (0.5)
- Tombow Fudenosuke brush pen (hard and soft tip)
- Tombow brush markers

## Cover page

TBH I had and still have no idea what to do for my cover page, so I just glued on this emoti doodle from a TCMC printable (it was a freebie in her Facebook group). It should work well with anything I add later to this page.

## Index

It's always great to keep a list of the most important pages in your bujo. Sadly, this a&o notebook doesn't come with numbered pages, so I may have to spend a few minutes doing that.

## Yearly Overview

Made a huge mistake lol ðŸ˜…, as you can see, the fix is pretty visible. oh well...

## Monthly Habits

A wonderful idea I lifted off Helen from TheCoffeeMonsterzCo[^1]!

Keep track of things you have to do every month. It's pretty empty for now, but I will add in some tasks later.

## Weight and Health tracker

Simple graph to keep track of my weight, and also a box per month to keep track of my health.

## Read Books and Favorite Music tracker

A great opportunity to practive sketching the book and album covers out! Of course, it's blank now, but hopefully it looks all filled out and nice by the end of 2021.

## Budget overview

A simple yearly budget overview. I'm not yet sure how I want to do my monthly/ day-to-day budgeting.

## Lists

I have kept my lists scattered throughout (on my phone, sticky notes, different planners or notebooks, etc.). Hopefully this will keep it all organized in one place, so its easier to find.

## Happy Mail tracker
