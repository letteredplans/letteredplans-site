Hello and welcome to my new site! Hopefully this is easier for me to maintain, meaning less broken pages, links, and more blog posts! Most of the old (and most important) blog posts have been migrated over by this point.

If there's any issue with the site, any broken links etc., please file an issue on Github - [https://github.com/letteredplans/letteredplans.github.io/issues]().

Since this is being hosted by Github Pages, the rendered HTML files and details are [here](https://github.com/letteredplans/letteredplans.github.io/).

You can see when the site was last built, etc.

Thanks for reading!
