It's that time of year again... time for all the flips, setups, walkthroughs, and lineups.

After a long (unexpected) hiatus from Youtube I am finally back!

This is my grey Leuchtturm1917 (A5). The only things I'm not that excited about is the yellow and thin paper. But other than that, there's a reason that I've been using it for most of my 3 years :)


Collections I did:
1. Yearly overview
2. Monthly tasks
3. Social media stats tracker
4. Year in Pixels
5. Favorite music
6. Books read


Supplies used:
- Leuchtturm1917 A5 Bullet journal
- MUJI Black gel pen (0.5)
- Tombow Fudenosuke (mostly hard tip)
- Tombow Brush pens (greyscale)

I hope you'll have a great start to 2020!
