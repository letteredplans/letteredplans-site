# About Me

**Hello! I'm `earnest`, the person behind Lettered Plans.**

[This is my personal site and blog](https://earnestma.xyz/).

I share both my functional and memory planner spreads, bullet journal spreads, sometimes note-taking and study videos, stationery, vlogs, and more! While planning, I love listening to music, podcasts, and drinking tea.

My fave planners so far are:
- Archer & Olive notebook (bullet journaling)
- printpression weeks
- A6 Rings
- Recollections Planner

Please [follow me](/#social-media) on social media, and I hope to see you around soon. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ’—
