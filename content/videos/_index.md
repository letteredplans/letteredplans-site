# Help with captions and subtitles

YouTube is sadly taking out their community captioning feature. However, I will still try to work on English subtitles through [Amara](https://amara.org/).

If you want to help translate that into other languages, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EduyGGv), there's more info and help available there.
